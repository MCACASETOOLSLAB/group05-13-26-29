This proble of roller coaster is done till now only for one car this can be extendede for multi cars then following rules are to 
be applied


• Only one car can be boarding at a time.
• Multiple cars can be on the track concurrently.
• Since cars can’t pass each other, they have to unload in the same order
they boarded.
• All the threads from one carload must disembark before any of the threads
from subsequent carloads.



Overview of solution can be 
 loadingArea = [Semaphore(0) for i in range(m)]
 loadingArea[1].signal()
 unloadingArea = [Semaphore(0) for i in range(m)]
 unloadingArea[1].signal()
 def next(i):
 return (i + 1) % m




Car Code:
 loadingArea[i].wait()
 load()
 boardQueue.signal(C)
 allAboard.wait()
 loadingArea[next(i)].signal()

 run()

 unloadingArea[i].wait()
 unload()
 unboardQueue.signal(C)
 allAshore.wait()
 unloadingArea[next(i)].signal()

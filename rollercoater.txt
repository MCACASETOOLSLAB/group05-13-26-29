 Suppose there are n passengers and one roller coaster car. The passengers repeatedly wait to ride in the car, which can hold maximum C passengers, where C < n. However, the car can go around the track only when it is full. After finishes a ride, each passenger wanders around the amusement park before returning to the roller coaster for another ride. Due to safety reasons, the car only rides T times and then shot-off.

 Suppose the car and each passenger are represented by a thread. How would you write a program, using semaphores only, that can simulate this system and fulfill the following requirements:

     The car always rides with exactly C passengers;
         No passengers will jump off the car while the car is running;
	     No passengers will jump on the car while the car is running;
	         No passengers will request another ride before they can get off the car.
